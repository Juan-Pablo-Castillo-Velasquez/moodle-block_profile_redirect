# Profile Redirect Block
The Profile Redirect block allows your institution to automatically redirect a user from
the front page of the site or the My Moodle page (depending on the location of the 
Redirect block) to a different course. The course that the user is redirected to is based
on a value in a mapped profile field that matches the value in a specified field within
the course settings. This block provides clients with flexibility in their userâ€™s
landing page beyond the front page and My Moodle page.

This plugin was contributed by the Open LMS Product Development team. Open LMS is an education technology company
dedicated to bringing excellent online teaching to institutions across the globe.  We serve colleges and universities,
schools and organizations by supporting the software that educators use to manage and deliver instructional content to
learners in virtual classrooms.
